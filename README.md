Interact with a page's background and modify visibility

This project was created by following [How To Make Image Background Change Effect On Website Using HTML CSS And JavaScript](https://youtu.be/Z7kmaWcMJBY?si=4lcV7Jv_SfPwzbZ5)

## Key Features and Technologies
- JavaScript, HTML, CSS
- DOM Manipulation
- Event Listeners

## How To Use
Move your cursor over the image to shift the appearance of a transparent background from left to right.

## Future Features
- Make the cursor bar/elemnent on the image click and drag, rather than follow the mouse
- Additionally, have the cursor stay in place when released from drag
- Apply the same functionality, but wipe vertically instead
